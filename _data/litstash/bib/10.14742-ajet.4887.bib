Central to this concept are the two opposing philosophical views: &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;learning from &amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;technology (amplification view of technology) versus &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;learning with &amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;technology (constructivist view of technology). A literature review is provided on the paradigm shift in educational technologies from the “learning from paradigm” to the “learning with”&amp;lt;em&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;paradigm. While the literature review shows powerful affordances of emerging technologies in engaging community of learners in knowledge construction and building, a critical analysis also indicates a significant gap in the traditional conception of cognitive tools, that is, a lack of research in the motivational and social dimension.  Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate the motivational and social dimensions of cognitive tools in the context of emerging technologies, with the substantiation of empirical evidence from the literature.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;}, number={2}, journal={Australasian Journal of Educational Technology}, author={Ge, Xun and Turk, Murat and Hung, Woei}, year={2019}, month={May} }
